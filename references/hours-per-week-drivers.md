# Hours Per Week Estimation Rubric & Drivers

## Purpose
This document establishes a rigorous framework for estimating the *real* weekly hour commitment of a Product Management role based on external signals. It moves beyond "guessing" to a grounded calculation based on research into organizational behavior and startup dynamics.

## The Formula
**Estimated Hours = Baseline (45h) + Stage Adjuster + Culture Modifiers + Leadership Modifiers + Role Modifiers**

---

## 1. Baseline
**Standard Senior/Principal PM:** **45 hours**
*   *Rationale:* Tech PM roles are inherently "infinite work" jobs. Even in healthy orgs, the context switching, stakeholder management, and strategic thinking require more than a strict 40-hour clock-in/clock-out.

## 2. Stage Adjusters (Choose One)

| Stage | Adjustment | Why? | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Seed / Series A** | **+10 to +15h** | "Survival Mode." Existential risk requires "whatever it takes" effort. | Employees avg 50-60h; Founders 60-100h. ([Karl Hughes][1]) |
| **Growth (Series B-D)** | **+5 to +10h** | "Scaling Pains." Massive hiring, breaking processes, and pressure to justify valuation. | "All-hands-on-deck" culture persists to reach liquidity events. ([Quora][2]) |
| **Late Stage / Pre-IPO** | **+0 to +5h** | "Professionalizing." Stable-ish, but often pre-IPO sprint pressure to hit quarterly targets. | Shift to more specialized roles; hours stabilize. ([DesignGurus][3]) |
| **Public Company** | **-5 to +5h** | "Steady State" vs "Turnaround." Mature orgs can be 40h, but "Transformation" initiatives spike it back up. | US avg is 42.9h; FAANG PMs report better WLB. ([DesignGurus][3]) |

## 3. Culture Modifiers (Add all that apply)

| Signal | Adjustment | Indicators (Keywords) | Validation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Wartime" / Turnaround** | **+10h** | "Transformation," "Restructuring," "Replacing legacy systems." | Turnaround contexts spike load due to "crisis" cadence. |
| **Velocity / Grind Culture** | **+10h** | "Sprint by Sprint," "High Slope," "Urgency," "Unscalable things." | "Fast-paced" in JDs correlates with high burnout/turnover. ([Glassdoor][4]) |
| **Toxic / High Churn** | **+10h** | "Burning reps," "High turnover," "Micromanagement." | Toxic environments create "performative work" hours. |
| **"We're a Family"** | **+5h** | "Family," "Work hard play hard," "Mission above all." | Code for "no boundaries" and emotional manipulation. ([Forbes][6]) |
| **Sustainability Focus** | **-5h** | "Recharge days," "Mental health breaks," "Async first." | Explicit policies (like Rula's 2 shutdown weeks) structurally reduce hours. |

## 4. Leadership Modifiers (Bullshit Detection)

| Signal | Adjustment | Why? | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ex-Amazon / "Hardcore" Pedigree** | **+5h** | Leaders from Amazon/Uber often import "Bias for Action" and "High Standards" as code for overwork. | "Unreasonably high standards" and "Customer Obsession" correlate with burnout. ([Effy][7]) |
| **First-Time Founder (Early Stage)** | **+5h** | "Chaos Tax." Lack of process, struggle to delegate, "all-in" mentality. | First-time founders rely on passion/hours over process. ([Medium][8]) |
| **Experienced / Second-Time Founder** | **-5h** | "Stability Credit." They know how to scale without breaking people. More intentional culture. | Second-time founders invest in management/culture earlier. ([DQ Ventures][9]) |

## 5. Role Modifiers (Add all that apply)

| Factor | Adjustment | Why? | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0 → 1 Product** | **+5h** | Ambiguity tax. Finding PMF requires rapid iteration and failure. | Launch phases intensify hours significantly. ([DesignGurus][3]) |
| **Strategic / Core Product** | **+5h** | Revenue-critical. High executive scrutiny = more slide decks. | Revenue-generating PMs face higher external market pressure. ([Reddit][5]) |
| **Internal Tools / Platform** | **-5h** | "Captive audience." Lower churn risk. Deadlines are often softer. | Can be lower stress, though frustration exists due to understaffing. ([Reddit][5]) |
| **New Domain Tax** | **+5h (temp)** | First 6 months require extra study time to learn jargon (e.g., BioTech). | Learning curve adds "study time" on top of work time. |

## 6. Calculation Examples (Validated)

### Example A: Ramp (Generalist PM)
*   **Baseline:** 45h
*   **Stage:** Late Stage / Pre-IPO (+5h)
*   **Culture:** "Velocity" (+10h)
*   **Leadership:** Founder tracks "days since founding" / Hardcore DNA (+5h)
*   **Role:** Core Revenue Product (+5h)
*   **Total:** **70 hours** (Updated based on Leadership Risk).

### Example B: Rula (Staff PM, AI)
*   **Baseline:** 45h
*   **Stage:** Series C (+5h)
*   **Culture:** "Sustainability Focus" (-5h)
*   **Role:** Internal Tool / Optimization (-5h)
*   **Total:** **40 hours**.

### Example C: GEICO (Principal PM)
*   **Baseline:** 45h
*   **Stage:** Public (+0h)
*   **Culture:** "Wartime" / "Turnaround" (+15h)
*   **Leadership:** New "Tech" Leadership enforcing "StratOps" (+5h)
*   **Role:** Core Strategy (+5h)
*   **Total:** **70 hours**.

## 7. Validation & Evidence (Trustworthy Citations)

The rubric is grounded in the following research:

1.  **Startup Hours by Stage:** Research confirms that Series A employees average 50-60h/week due to "survival mode," while public company employees average closer to 40-45h. Founder intensity (60-100h) is a key multiplier in early stages. ([Karl Hughes][1])
2.  **"Fast-Paced" Red Flag:** Glassdoor analysis confirms that JDs using "fast-paced" or "high intensity" keywords are statistically correlated with lower WLB ratings and higher burnout reports. ([Glassdoor][4])
3.  **Internal vs. External PM:** Industry discussions (Reddit/Blind) confirm that Internal Tools PMs often face lower *market* pressure but higher *political* pressure. The "-5h" adjustment reflects the lack of "customer fire drills," though the role brings its own challenges. ([Reddit][5])
4.  **Leadership Impact:** "Ex-Amazon" leadership often correlates with "unreasonably high standards" and burnout risks. Conversely, second-time founders are statistically more likely to build sustainable cultures early. ([Effy][7], [Medium][8])
