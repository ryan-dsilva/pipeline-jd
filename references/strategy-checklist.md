 - Evidence quotes (at least 2)
 - Source diversity check (company site + independent coverage + competitor/market source)
 - Competitor positioning/target/model + differentiation vs. company
 - Pricing: structure (what units they charge for), price levels, and implications. If not on site, check Reddit/G2/Capterra and cite; otherwise state assumption.
