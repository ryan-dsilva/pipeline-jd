## Summary
Principal Product Manager and ex-engineer building commercially focused generative AI products for doctors and pharma clients at VuMedi. Previously, I worked on Grammarly's generative AI (before and after the launch of ChatGPT), end-to-end fintech at Eventbrite (checkout, pricing, accounting, payouts), top-of-funnel B2B growth and conversion plus B2C purchase flows for SMB revenue at Yelp, and external and internal fraud prevention tools at PayPal. Earlier in my career as a full-stack engineer, I built high-availability fraud protection systems, prototyped new e-commerce products and 3D graphics, and developed APIs for real-time agent communication. Today, my specialty is mid-funnel engagement and retention. I deeply understand customer jobs and the key tasks that unlock retention, combine user interviews with product analytics, A/B tests, and cohort analysis, then shift to hands-on creation of lean prototypes—using wireframes or, for generative AI, Python/Jupyter workflows and agents—that evolve into scalable product experiences in B2B SaaS, fintech, and healthtech.
