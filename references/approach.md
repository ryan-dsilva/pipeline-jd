# Consultative Cover Letter Approach (Tech 2025)

## Strategy
Write as a peer/consultant. Do not say "I fit the requirements." Say "I understand your problem."

## Decode the JD
Ask:
- What critical business problem is behind this hire?
- What unspoken pain point exists in AI/data maturity?
- Which resume story best proves the problem can be solved?

## Template Guidance (Crisp + Skimmable)
- Keep to ~150–250 words unless user requests otherwise.
- Use short paragraphs (2–3 sentences each) and high-signal phrasing.
- Open with a very brief intro: role + company + immediate value signal.
- Reverse‑engineer the transition (State A → State B) in one sentence.
- Prove credibility with one insight + one measurable result.
- Close with a collaborative, low‑pressure invite to compare notes.

## Resume Story Selection
Prefer these themes when relevant:
- VuMedi: AI/GenAI adoption, engagement, retention
- Grammarly: GenAI product strategy, embeddings, engagement
- Eventbrite: scaling systems, fintech, IPO readiness

## Output Requirements
- Target 150–250 words.
- Use a consultative tone; avoid applicant language.
- Prioritize hook, clarity, and scan‑ability.
- Include a short keyword line near the end for ATS (comma‑separated, role‑relevant).
- Mirror the job title and top 6–10 JD keywords naturally.
- Avoid generic templates or boilerplate openings.

## Experience Signal (Subtle)
- Add one short line that signals pattern recognition, judgment, and calm execution without mentioning years or age.
- Example pattern: "I bring pattern‑level judgment on when to push, when to steady the pace, and how to deliver durable outcomes efficiently."

## Intro Guidance (Busy Readers)
- One sentence, 20–30 words max.
- Include: role title + company + your strongest relevant credential.
- Example pattern: "I’m excited about the {{ROLE_TITLE}} role at {{COMPANY_NAME}} and bring {{X}} years driving {{OUTCOME}} in {{DOMAIN}}."
