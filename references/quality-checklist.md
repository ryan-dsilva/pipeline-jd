# Role Fit Analysis - Final Quality Checklist

**Usage:** Run this ONLY after drafting the analysis. If any check fails, fix it before marking "Complete".

## 1. Critical Artifacts
- [ ] **Evidence File Exists:** Full JD text + extracted quotes saved in `/Users/ryan/Next/role-analyses/evidence/`.
- [ ] **Analysis File Exists:** Saved as `score-XX...md`.
- [ ] **Tracker Updated:** Row added/updated in the appropriate tracker file (`tracker-active.md`, `tracker-applied.md`, or `tracker-ignored.md`) with status `Complete`.

## 2. Gate & Policy Compliance
- [ ] **Location Valid:** Role is confirmed Remote or Hybrid (SF).
- [ ] **Filename Correct:** Matches `score-<SCORE>__hours-<XX>__<STATUS>__<Company>__<Role>__<Date>__<PostedDate>.md`.
- [ ] **Deduplication:** No other file exists for this same JD URL.

## 3. Data Integrity (The "Hard" Stuff)
- [ ] **Hours Estimate:** Contains a specific range (e.g., "50-55h") backed by a cited source (Review/Sprint/Founder).
- [ ] **Pricing:** Company pricing model (units/tiers) is explicitly stated or noted as "Unknown" with a cited search attempt.
- [ ] **Leadership:** Founder & CPO bios include *prior roles* and *tenure* (not just current title).
- [ ] **Competitors:** At least 3 specific competitors listed with differentiation.
- [ ] **Source Diversity:** At least 3 sources across domains (Site, News, Reviews, Social/Video).

## 4. Formatting & Hygiene
- [ ] **Template Compliance:** All sections from `role-analysis-template.md` are present.
- [ ] **Citations:** Inline Markdown links `[Source](url)` used throughout.
- [ ] **No "Sources" Section:** References are inline only.
- [ ] **Clean Output:** No tool invocation tokens or internal logs in the final markdown.
