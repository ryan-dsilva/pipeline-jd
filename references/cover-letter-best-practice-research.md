# Cover Letter Best Practices in Tech (2025) — Research Report

Date: 2026-01-04
Scope: Tech hiring in 2025, with emphasis on candid recruiter/hiring‑manager commentary and ATS behavior.

## Executive Summary (What the evidence supports)
- Cover letters are **not universally read**, but credible surveys show **many hiring managers still read them** and believe they influence interview decisions. This means a strong, tailored letter can help in competitive slates, while a weak or generic one can hurt. [Resume Genius survey, 2024/2025 update](https://resumegenius.com/blog/cover-letter-help/cover-letter-statistics)
- Some tech leaders **explicitly value writing quality in cover letters** (e.g., DHH/37signals), especially for remote collaboration and signal of effort. [Business Insider interview](https://www.businessinsider.com/david-heinemeier-hansson-looks-2-things-hiring-cover-letter-2025-7)
- ATS platforms accept and store cover letters as candidate uploads; file format requirements are standardized (.pdf/.doc/.docx/.rtf/.txt). This supports the idea that cover letters are ingested into ATS systems (even if they’re not always used to filter). [Greenhouse Support](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360052218132-Supported-formats-for-resumes-cover-letters-and-other-candidate-uploads)
- ATS search behavior is typically keyword‑based (job titles/skills). If ATS search is used for cover letters, **keywords that match the JD materially improve findability**. [Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/cover-letter-robot-approved/)

## What Hiring Managers & Recruiters Say (Candid Signals)
- **Writing quality and effort are direct filters** at some tech companies. DHH (CTO, 37signals) explicitly says a poor, non‑specific cover letter is disqualifying and that writing quality is essential for remote collaboration. [Business Insider interview](https://www.businessinsider.com/david-heinemeier-hansson-looks-2-things-hiring-cover-letter-2025-7)
- **Survey evidence suggests cover letters are still read** by a majority of hiring managers and can influence interviews; 83% report reading most cover letters and 94% say they influence interview decisions. [Resume Genius survey](https://resumegenius.com/blog/cover-letter-help/cover-letter-statistics)
- **Anecdotal recruiter sentiment is mixed**: some recruiters say they skip cover letters due to volume or consider them optional. (Use as directional, not definitive.) [r/askrecruiters thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askrecruiters/comments/1mldtrh/)

Interpretation for tech in 2025: You should assume **some decision‑makers still read cover letters**, especially for senior, remote, or writing‑heavy roles. But many high‑volume recruiters won’t read weak or generic letters—so quality matters more than frequency.

## ATS Reality: What Systems Likely Do With Cover Letters
- ATS systems typically store cover letters as candidate uploads and accept standard file types (.doc/.docx/.pdf/.rtf/.txt). citeturn5view0
- ATS search is keyword‑driven; hiring managers often search ATS databases by job titles and skills. If cover letters lack those terms, they’re less discoverable in ATS searches. citeturn4view2

What this means:
- ATS **may not “score”** cover letters in all systems, but they **do store and index them** in many workflows.
- Including **job‑relevant keywords** in a natural way is the safest assumption for ATS visibility.

## Best Practices That Hold Up in 2025
### 1) Treat the cover letter as a **specific, problem‑solving brief**
- Use the JD to identify the 1–2 core business problems and show evidence of solving similar problems.
- Include quantifiable outcomes (revenue, engagement, efficiency, risk reduction).
- Avoid generic “I’m excited” openings without proof of relevance.

### 2) Optimize for ATS *and* human readers
- Mirror critical **job title + skills** in the JD (without stuffing). ATS search relies on keywords. [Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/cover-letter-robot-approved/)
- Use **plain formatting** and supported file types (.pdf or .docx). [Greenhouse Support](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360052218132-Supported-formats-for-resumes-cover-letters-and-other-candidate-uploads)
 - Keep it short: 3–4 short paragraphs, ~150–250 words unless the role explicitly expects more. (Survey data suggests many managers skim quickly; shorter helps.) [Resume Genius survey](https://resumegenius.com/blog/cover-letter-help/cover-letter-statistics)

### 3) Prove interest and context that a resume can’t show
- Explain “why this company, why now” with a concrete product or market insight.
- This is where a strong cover letter becomes a **tie‑breaker** for similar resumes. [Resume Genius survey](https://resumegenius.com/blog/cover-letter-help/cover-letter-statistics)

### 4) Show you can write clearly
- Clear, concise writing is a performance signal in tech and remote roles.
- Some hiring leaders explicitly treat cover letters as a writing test. [Business Insider interview](https://www.businessinsider.com/david-heinemeier-hansson-looks-2-things-hiring-cover-letter-2025-7)

## What to Avoid (Common Disqualifiers)
 - **Generic templates** with minimal tailoring (signals low effort; doesn’t help ATS keyword matching). [Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/cover-letter-robot-approved/)
- **Keyword stuffing** that reads robotic or inauthentic (hurts human review).
 - **Overly long letters**; many hiring managers skim quickly. [Resume Genius survey](https://resumegenius.com/blog/cover-letter-help/cover-letter-statistics)
- **Repeating the resume**; instead add context: decisions, tradeoffs, and impact.

## When a Cover Letter Is Most Valuable in Tech
- **Senior/Principal roles**: differentiation and narrative matter.
- **Remote or writing‑heavy roles**: cover letter acts as a writing sample. citeturn3view4
- **Career pivots or gaps**: provides context the resume doesn’t convey.
- **Competitive roles**: can be a tie‑breaker among similar candidates. citeturn6view0

## Practical Checklist (Tech 2025)
- 1 sentence: role + immediate value proposition.
- 1–2 sentences: the business problem you understand.
- 2–3 bullets or short sentences: proof with outcomes + metrics.
- 1 sentence: why this company (specific product/strategy signal).
- Close with a confident, low‑pressure CTA.
- Embed 6–10 job‑critical keywords naturally.
- Save as PDF or DOCX; avoid complex formatting. [Greenhouse Support](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360052218132-Supported-formats-for-resumes-cover-letters-and-other-candidate-uploads)
